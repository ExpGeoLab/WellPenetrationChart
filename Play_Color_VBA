' Worksheet_Change Event Handler
' 
' Description:
'   This VBA macro automatically changes the background color of a cell when a valid
'   HEX color code (e.g., #FF5733) is entered into the cell. The HEX code must:
'   - Start with a "#" symbol.
'   - Be exactly 7 characters long (e.g., "#RRGGBB").
' 
' How It Works:
'   1. The macro triggers whenever a change is made to any cell in the worksheet.
'   2. It checks if the entered value is a valid HEX color code.
'   3. If valid, it extracts the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) components from the HEX code.
'   4. It then applies the corresponding color to the cell's background.
' 
' Notes:
'   - The HEX code must be in the format "#RRGGBB" (e.g., "#FF5733" for orange).
'   - The macro temporarily disables event handling to avoid infinite loops.
'   - If an error occurs, the macro safely exits and re-enables event handling.
' 
' Example:
'   Enter "#FF5733" into a cell, and the cell's background will turn orange.
